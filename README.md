# MiReDoMarket

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### 프로젝트 설명 : 정해진 미니게임을 플레이하고 점수를 얻어 본인의 점수를 등록하는 랭킹 시스템이 있는 게임 사이트
 구현 동기 : 닌텐도 ‘마리오 파티’ 게임에서 여러가지 미니게임들을 플레이하며 다른사람과 경쟁을 하면 간단한 미니게임이라도 재밌다는 것을 알게되었고, 4명 뿐이 아닌 여러명이서 건전한 경쟁을 할 수 있는 사이트를 만들고 싶어서
 
 
 구현 방법 : setTimeOut함수를 이용하여 정해진 시간동안 게임들을 플레이 가능하도록 하였고, 여러가지 미니게임들을 바닐라 자바스크립트를 활용하여 만들었다. 정보 추가 및 읽기의 경우 php, ajax를 이용하여 JSON파일에 접근하는 방식을 이용하였고, Bootstrap을 이용하여 반응형 웹 페이지로 제작하였다.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
